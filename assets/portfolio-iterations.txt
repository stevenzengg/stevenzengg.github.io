What features on this portfolio should I work on next?

1. Add different themes (light mode vs. dark mode, retro tabs vs. macos tabs)

2. Autocomplete commands with tab

3. grepl

4. stevenGPT.app terminal chatbot

5. more hidden files! (ideas, anyone?)

6. game! (likely protect a file with a password, leave breadcrumbs for user to derive it)

7. allow users to move files around!

8. add file names to headers!

9. create minimize functionality! (but how to keep track of minimized tabs UI-wise?)

10. create voting system for what iteration i should work on next! (should i go into product?)

11. exit command

12. navigating and altering input command from anywhere

13. adding a GUI finder for non-tech peeps
