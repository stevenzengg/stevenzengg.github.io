Order Processing Capabilities ...worked on carmax order processing. usually with these blogs, i start with a quick excerpt
of what the team does - but at my first internship, i had a completely different side project, so let's dive into that instead!



with a fellow intern, i hacked together a developer velocity measurement tool to stack rank all engineers and aggregate metrics
at every level of the management chain. jk ...or am i? actually, my manager was very adamant that different teams specializing
in different areas of the codebase would use the tool on an individual basis, so i should not worry about introducing said
toxicity into the company. 



anyhow, my partner took on the frontend while i took on the backend. i also lead the project lifecycle
(of which i had to research first) - what a time. i created a simple project charter, scope, and general plan. i also scheduled stakeholder
meetings with many engineers to iterate on what core functionalities this tool should aim for. with some general design out of the
way (choose this tech stack bc of ___), i tracked my work via rally boards and user stories in kanbaan and implemented the entire API
layer -> db representation -> db querying. i used git-hub webhooks to track commit data with secure encryption to populate the db. 



i will need to fill in the blanks on tech and design. also need to talk about the annual CarMax hackathon that i won. stay tuned!
