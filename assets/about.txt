Hi! I'm Steven Zeng.



I like building helpful things. I've built programs for companies 
such as Google, Amazon, AT&T, and CarMax. I graduated Penn State University
with majors in Computer Science and Applied Statistics and minors in 
Mathematics and Engineering Leadership Development. You can find more about my
work under the experiences/ and projects/ folders (hah jokes on you, not all are complete).



Beyond software, I (surprisingly) have a few hobbies. I love to travel (not sure how to manifest this one yet - perhaps in this portfolio, or perhaps in a vsco),
gymming (so much that I certified as a personal trainer) and cooking (unless your company provides free food, please contact me).



Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my portfolio. I hope you have as 
much fun exploring it as I have building it. If you have any questions,
please feel free to get in touch! I love meeting new people and catching up with
old friends. I also appreciate feedback if you have any (please find form.app).
Otherwise, please reach out to me via email, linkedin, or even instagram. Finally, you can also find
this portfolio on my github!
