alexa video at amazon owns the experience e2e for the alexa video app,
which is found on amazon's multi-modal (ones with screens) home devices. it connects 
users to content by integrating with providers like prime video, netflix, etc. bts,
it works on UI rendering, API integration, and cross-surface behavior. is it discontinued?
i don't know (nda) but unfortunately amazon's home devices business may not have made record
margins as was hoped (my project is still cool tho! promise!)




to render a screen (or as alexa named them, an experience) in the app, alexa presentation language defines the visual designs
and interactive elements, while downstream services (such as the one I created) plug in
to process and deliver content. at the widget level, said content was statically
generated. in the most jarring use-case, this meant that every user on the app would see the
same list of genres in the same order. to personalize this experience, i fully designed and
implemented a widget ranking platform with multiple layers (ranking, aggregation) and interfaces
(entry point, ranking strategy). as one of my first internships, i learned many skills on the fly.
pertaining high level, i defined API contracts/responsibilities, data models, and microservices. pertaining low level, I designed
interfaces, abstract classes, used dependency injection, factory patterns, test-driven development, etc.




i also created an example ranker and presented the final functionality to higher leadership.

stay tuned for more edits! tbWritten:
