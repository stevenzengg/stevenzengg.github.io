note: projects (and some experiences) are unfinished - try "HELP" to see which ones

second note: these commands work with nested files/directories as params! although there is only multi-layer
directory in this site for now, and it's the easter egg :)

last note: try closing and resizing and dragging and minimizing and maximizing tabs! maybe just for fun!
